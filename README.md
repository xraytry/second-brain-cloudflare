You use Claude for some things, ChatGPT for others, Cursor for code. But your context — your projects, decisions, preferences — doesn’t move with you. You re-explain yourself constantly.

Second Brain fixes that. One shared memory, available in every AI tool you use.

And unlike the built-in memory inside any single app, this one is yours. It lives in your own account. No platform controls it, and no platform can take it away.

## How it works

Connect Second Brain to whichever AI tools you use. Then tell it things once. It finds them later by meaning, so asking “what did I decide about the pricing model?” surfaces the right note even if you never used those exact words when you saved it.

| Tool          | What it does                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `remember`    | Store anything: ideas, decisions, project context            |
| `append`      | Add updates to an existing entry without creating duplicates |
| `update`      | Replace an entry’s content entirely                          |
| `recall`      | Finds memories by meaning, not exact wording                 |
| `list_recent` | Browse recent memories by date                               |
| `forget`      | Delete an entry                                              |

## Save from anywhere

Memory is only useful if it actually gets filled. Second Brain connects to the tools and moments where context naturally lives.

- **CLI** — `brain remember`, `brain recall`, and more from your terminal — `npm install -g second-brain-cf-cli`
- **Obsidian** — notes sync automatically via the [community plugin](https://github.com/rahilp/second-brain-obsidian-plugin) · available in [Obsidian Community Plugins](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/second-brain-sync)
- **iOS** — Brain Dump, Text Brain Dump, and Save to Brain shortcuts in [`integrations/ios-shortcuts/`](integrations/ios-shortcuts/)
- **Browser extension** — capture any page or highlighted text in one click via the [Chrome extension](https://github.com/rahilp/second-brain-browser-extension)
- **Bookmarklet** — lightweight option in [`integrations/bookmarklet.js`](integrations/bookmarklet.js)
- **Any AI client** — use `remember` mid-conversation, right when something matters

## Quick Start

> **Before you deploy:** You’ll be asked to set an `AUTH_TOKEN` — the password your AI clients use to connect. Use a memorable phrase (`coffee-lover-2026`) or run `openssl rand -base64 32` for a stronger one. **Save it** — you'll need it in step 3.

1. **[Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/rahilp/second-brain-cloudflare)** — one click, everything provisions automatically. Set your `AUTH_TOKEN` when prompted.

1. **Using Claude Code or Codex CLI?** Run one command and paste in your worker URL — it wires up global instructions *and* the MCP connection via OAuth, so your token never touches the script:

   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux / WSL / Git Bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahilp/second-brain-cloudflare/main/scripts/connect-ai-clients.sh | bash -s -- https://YOUR-WORKER-URL
   ```
   ```powershell
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   iex "& { $(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rahilp/second-brain-cloudflare/main/scripts/connect-ai-clients.ps1) } -WorkerUrl https://YOUR-WORKER-URL"
   ```

1. **Using ChatGPT or Claude (desktop app or web)?** These need two quick manual steps in their UI — paste your custom instructions into their personalization settings, and add `https://YOUR-WORKER-URL/mcp` as a custom MCP connector. Each app's exact menus differ, so follow the **[per-app steps in the wiki](../../wiki/Connect-to-AI-Clients)**.

That’s it. Your memory is live and ready across every tool you connect.

```bash
# Verify it's working (replace YOUR-WORKER-URL and YOUR-TOKEN with your values)
curl -X POST https://YOUR-WORKER-URL/capture \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "second brain is working", "source": "test"}'
# → {"ok":true,"id":"..."}
```

### OAuth for browser-based clients

The `/mcp` endpoint supports **OAuth 2.0** (discovery + dynamic client registration),
so any MCP client that can open a browser to authenticate connects without ever
putting a token in a config file or URL. When you add `https://<your-worker-url>/mcp`
as a connector, the client detects the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, registers itself,
and opens the worker's hosted login
page; **enter your `AUTH_TOKEN`** there to authorize. claude.ai, ChatGPT, Claude Code
(`claude mcp add --transport http second-brain <url>/mcp`, no `--header` needed), and
Codex CLI (`codex mcp add second-brain --url <url>/mcp`, which detects OAuth support
and starts the login flow itself) all use this flow.

Clients that can't open a browser — e.g. `mcp-remote` in headless contexts — can still
fall back to the static token via `Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>`.

OAuth needs a KV namespace (`OAUTH_KV`) to store tokens and client registrations.

The **Deploy to Cloudflare** button provisions it automatically.

**Deploying manually:** Simply run `npm run deploy`. Wrangler will auto-provision the necessary resources and fill out the rest of your wrangler.jsonc file.
